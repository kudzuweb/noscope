# Build record

One entry per PR, appended when the PR merges: what was built, why, and whether it matches
`BUILD-PLAN.md` and `DESIGN.md` exactly. Where it does not, the deviation and its reason are
here, and the design or plan was updated in the same PR.

## PR 1: Skeleton (#1, merged 2026-09-12)

Built: a pnpm TypeScript package for Node 24 with biome, vitest, knip and a CI workflow
running `pnpm check`; `bin/noscope.mjs` printing help and version; `src/cli.ts` with one
command table where every command in the design's Step 7 is registered and a command
without a handler is the exit-3 stub; README install section.

Not exactly to spec, with reasons:

- The launcher is `bin/noscope.mjs`, not `bin/noscope`, so biome lints it; an extensionless
  file is skipped.
- The CLI parses with Node's `util.parseArgs` and dispatches through a command table with an
  optional `handler`; the plan did not specify a mechanism. Chosen so `--help` works anywhere
  and later PRs land a command by filling one row.
- Two conventions the plan and design lacked were added to `DESIGN.md` in this PR because
  the code had to pick them: the exit-code table (0, 2, 3, 4, 5) in Step 7 and the SQLite
  path (`$NOSCOPE_DB`, else `~/.noscope/noscope.sqlite`) in Step 2.
- `tsconfig.typecheck.json` exists beside `tsconfig.json` so tests are typechecked without
  being built.
- The spike server under `spikes/` is excluded from lint and knip and kept byte-for-byte as
  it ran, since the design cites it as evidence.

## PR 2: Contracts (#2, merged 2026-09-12)

Built: `src/models.ts` with every schema the design names, `jsonSchemaFor()` for what
providers receive, `zod` 4 as the first runtime dependency, and tests.

Not exactly to spec, with reasons:

- `sessionResult(findings)` is a function returning one object schema with an `outcome`
  field and outcome-dependent rules, not a discriminated union. Two facts from a live check
  against Claude Code 2.1.270 forced this: `--json-schema` rejects a schema carrying a
  `$schema` key, and it forwards the schema as a tool input schema, which must be a
  top-level object, so a union is refused. `jsonSchemaFor()` therefore drops `$schema`
  and throws on a non-object schema. The design's Step 3 sketch now reads
  `sessionResult(InvestigateFindings)`.
- `Claim` gained `evidence: string[]`, because a session's claim proposals carry evidence
  pointers and the stored claim had nowhere to keep them.
- `Grant` ties `incidentId` to `scope`: null exactly when standing.
- `Timestamp` accepts an offset on read; the store writes `toISOString()`.
- `UnitProposal` carries a `ref` so a plan's new tasks can name a unit created in the same
  plan; the design did not say how that reference works.
- `Usage` (tokens and seconds) is a schema so `task.usage` events have a shape.

## PR 3: Store (#3, merged 2026-09-12)

Built: `src/store.ts` on `better-sqlite3` with the six tables, every write a named method
that performs its state change and records its event in one immediate transaction,
`replay()` that rebuilds the tables from the events, contract-parsed reads, and tests
including the replay test of acceptance criterion 7.

Not exactly to spec, with reasons:

- Not a general `transact(fn)`: writes are named methods, and each event's payload carries
  a `mutation` that says exactly what changed. A free-form transaction cannot be replayed
  because the event would not know what the function did. Replay applies the recorded
  mutation and nothing else; the review found that dispatching on event type applied a
  status live and dropped it on replay, and that a missing payload key became the string
  "undefined". The mutation is validated by a zod schema, so replay throws on either.
- Events carry a `scope`, `incident` or `system`, with a CHECK tying it to `incident_id`,
  at Mauria's call: a bare nullable column could not tell an intended system event from a
  bug that forgot its incident. A standing grant's `grant.given` is a system event.
- `UNIQUE (incident_id, sequence)` does not constrain NULLs in SQLite, so the uniqueness is
  an index on `COALESCE(incident_id, '')` and `sequence`.
- Transactions are `immediate`, and `busy_timeout` is 5 s, so a second process writing to
  the same file waits instead of failing on a snapshot conflict.
- Reads go through the contracts (`Incident.parse` and the rest), so a corrupt row or a
  hand-edited payload is caught on the way out, not silently returned.
- `claims` has `evidence_json`, missing from the design's table until now; a claim whose
  object is absent is stored as null rather than failing the NOT NULL constraint.
- `snapshot()` and `resolveDbPath()` were added; `record()` exists for events with no
  state change.


## PR 4: Incident commands (#4, merged 2026-09-13)

Built: `noscope incident create`, `show` and `events` over the store; handlers in
`src/commands/incident.ts` that parse their own flags strictly; `src/context.ts` holding the
shared types and the exit-code table; the incident file rendered with every section the
design lists; tests for acceptance criterion 1 and the exit codes.

Not exactly to spec, with reasons:

- `--budget` is `--budget-tokens N` and `--budget-seconds N`, since a budget has two
  dimensions in the contract.
- Handlers receive the raw arguments after the command words and parse them themselves,
  so `--constraint` repeats and an unknown flag exits 2; the top-level dispatcher knows only
  help and version.
- Incident ids are zero-padded ordinals, `001`, and the root unit is `001-command`.
- "Capabilities registered" prints "(none yet)" until PR 6 lands the registry.
- The store was hardened in this PR from the PR 3 review's final report, which arrived after
  PR 3 merged: updates verify they changed exactly one row, so an event is never recorded for
  a change that did not happen; writes validate their mutation before applying it, so a bad
  status cannot reach a table and poison every later read; `replay()` sorts events itself
  (system first, then per incident by sequence); the file carries a schema version and a
  file from another version is refused with a message rather than failing on the first
  write; `incident.questions` and `incident.capabilityRequests` mutations exist so PR 13 can
  store answers in the table; `batch()` runs several writes as one transaction for PR 11;
  the inserts name their columns; and the two task UPDATEs became one. A claim with no
  object stores null.
- The README's pun line now ends "not even to one-shot", at Mauria's ask.
